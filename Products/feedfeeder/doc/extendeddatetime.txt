DateTime parser implementation does not know about several of the important
daylight saving time zone variants in US. 

   >>> hard_time = 'Fri, 13 Mar 2009 10:30:00 EDT'
   >>> easy_time = 'Fri, 13 Mar 2009 10:30:00 EST'
   >>> from DateTime import DateTime
   >>> some_time = DateTime(easy_time)
   >>> bad_time = DateTime(hard_time)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
   SyntaxError: Fri, 13 Mar 2009 10:30:00 EDT
   
It would be nice to fix DateTime, but that's going to take a while, 
and this is one of those areas where we will always need a workaround to
something, so let's test our wrapper! 

   >>> from Products.feedfeeder.extendeddatetime import extendedDateTime
   >>> good_time = extendedDateTime(hard_time)
   >>> print good_time
   2009/03/13 10:30:00 GMT-4
   
Nice.
