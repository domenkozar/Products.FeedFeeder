DateTime parser implementation does not know about several of the important
daylight saving time zone variants in US. 

   >>> hard_time = 'Fri, 13 Mar 2009 10:30:00 EDT'
   >>> easy_time = 'Fri, 13 Mar 2009 10:30:00 EST'
   >>> from DateTime import DateTime
   >>> some_time = DateTime(easy_time)
   >>> bad_time = DateTime(hard_time)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
   SyntaxError: Fri, 13 Mar 2009 10:30:00 EDT

NOTE: if the above Exception is no longer thrown, then your underlying
Zope has probably been brought up-to-date.  At that point, 
extendeddatetime is relegated to helping to maintain functionality in older 
Zope versions.

Although it would be nice to fix DateTime, that's going to take a while, 
and this is one of those areas where due to the many "dodgy" RSS formats 
out there, we will always need a workaround to something, so let's get on 
and test our wrapper! 

   >>> from Products.feedfeeder.extendeddatetime import extendedDateTime
   >>> good_time = extendedDateTime(hard_time)
   >>> print good_time
   2009/03/13 10:30:00 GMT-4
   
Nice.
