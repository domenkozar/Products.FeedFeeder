History of feedfeeder
=====================

2.0.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Import HTMLParseError from the standard python HTMLParser instead of
  BeautifulSoup.  This makes feedfeeder compatible with BeautifulSoup
  3.0.x again.
  [maurits]


2.0 (2010-07-05)
----------------

- Solve some Plone 4 compatibility issues.
  [sureshvv]

- Ignore unidentifiable entries without id or link, instead of
  throwing an AttributeError.
  Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/26
  [maurits]


1.0.1 (2010-04-02)
------------------

- Fix errors when viewing a folder or item on Plone 4, while still
  keeping Plone 2.5 and Plone 3 compatibility.
  Refs http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/25
  [maurits]


1.0 (2009-12-23)
----------------

- Some summaries are a snippet from the full content, and then they
  can contain broken html; in this case we are now saving the raw
  broken html, parsing it only when possible.
  [lucmult]


1.0rc7 (2009-11-06)
-------------------

- Improved the translations stuffs
  [lucmult]

- Changed the way to translate xml/html entities from summary, now 
  using BeautifulSoup. Old way was breaking with some non ascii 
  characters.
  [lucmult]

- When setting the text of a feed item during updating, store the
  mimetype as well if it is a supported one.
  Refs http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/24
  [maurits]


1.0rc6 (2009-09-21)
-------------------

- Bug fix: curly quotes getting mangled when Descriptions are built.
  Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/7
  (Merged branch maurits-cleaner-entityrefs-in-description.)
  [maurits]


1.0rc5 (2009-07-02)
-------------------

- Do not add our skin layer to Plone Default and certainly not to
  Plone Tableless, but just to all (*).  [maurits]


1.0rc4 (2009-06-18)
-------------------

- When both the updated and published date of an item is not known,
  take today as the date when first adding it.  When updating, do not
  change the original item.
  Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/21
  [maurits]

- Read tags/categories/keywords of feed items and store them on the
  created content item.  No Archetypes field, just a simple getter and
  setter called feed_tags.   Idea: Robin Harms Oredsson.
  [maurits]

- DateTime.SyntaxError is thrown with some very common US 
  Daylight Saving zones, such as EDT. We now wrap the DateTime parsing
  of feeds, to try to recognise those zones before politely giving up, using 
  maurits' fix, below.
  [russf]
  
- Catch DateTime.SyntaxError when parsing the updated and published
  dates of an entry and continue with the next entry.
  Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/18
  [maurits]

- Avoid swallowing too much exceptions when applying our GenericSetup
  profile.
  Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/19
  [maurits]

1.0rc3 (2008-10-04)
-------------------

- Moved profile definition from python to GenericSetup.  Profile is
  now not 'profile-feedfeeder:default' but
  'profile-Products.feedfeeder:default'.  [maurits]

- In the Extensions/ dir: removed Install.py and renamed AppInstall.py
  to install.py.  [maurits]

- Made feed item updated date available for Collections/Smart Folders.
  [maurits]

- Extensions/AppInstall.py: first try installing our own profile in
  the Plone 3 way and when that fails try the Plone 2.5 way.
  [maurits]

- Removed own feedparser.py.  Instead added an install_requires
  dependency on FeedParser in setup.py.  [maurits]

- Moved fix for feeds starting with 'feed:' instead of 'http:' from
  feedparser.py to utilities.py, so we use an unchanged feedparser.py
  again.  [maurits]


1.0 rc 2 (2008-07-23)
---------------------

- Re-release of rc1: rc1 was missing all .txt files, making install impossible
  as setup.py reads version.txt. [reinout]


1.0 rc 1 (2008-07-15)
---------------------

- Accept entries without a title, which is allowed in rss.
  See http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt
  [maurits]


1.0 beta 4 (2008-05-20)
-----------------------

- Eggification: you can now install it as the Products.feedfeeder
  egg.  [maurits]


1.0 beta 3 (2008-05-13)
-----------------------

- In the tests, use plone_workflow explicitly, so it is easier to test
  on both Plone 2.5 and 3.0.  [maurits]

- Make update_feed_items available in the object_buttons for Plone 3,
  using new small @@is_feedcontainer as condition.  [maurits]

- Avoid deprecation warnings for events and interfaces.  [maurits]

- Remove semicolon in page template that broke in Plone 3.  [maurits]

- Fix imports so they work in Plone 3 as well, without deprecation
  warnings.  [derstappenit]


1.0 beta 2 (2008-01-02)
-----------------------

- History begins.
